# VScode Extensions

when using Vscode, there are a lot of extensions that can help you with your development. Here is a list of extensions that we use in our daily work.

- Mocha
- ES6 Mocha Snippets
- Indent Rainbow
- Prettier
- Eslint
- Console Ninja
- Github Copilot
- Add Only
- Cypress Fixture-IntelliSense

If you go to your Marketplace in VScode, you can search for these extensions and install them. Because we have added them within the repository in the `.vscode/extensions.json` file, you will be prompted to install them when you open the repository in VScode.

These extensions are not mandatory, but they can help you with your development. You can find more information about these extensions in the [VScode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
