# Setup CypressÂ tests in CICD

#@ Running in Pipeline in Gitlab CI

One of the most powerful ways to run Cypress tests is as part of your CICD process. Get quick feedback running a subset of your tests using mocks during your CI and run sets of E2E tests or Synthetic tests during your CD process.

The picture below shows a typical setup of a CICD pipeline setup.

## Exercise: Setup and create a CI/CD workflow using Gitlab

1. Go to [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab) and Login to your account or create a (free) account
2. Create a new (public or private, does not really mattter) repository for the training
3. Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root of your project
4. In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named e2e-tests.yml
5. Make a workflow using the official [Cypress Gitlab](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/gitlab-ci)
6. Make sure at least one of your tests has stubbed API requests/responses (see `cy.intercept()`)
7. Commit, Push and run your tests on Gitlab

## Exercise: Setup Cypress Cloud for your project

Now use your Gitlab CI/CD pipeline to run your tests and store the results in the Cypress Cloud.
