# Connecting to the cloud

> Connecting to the Cypress Cloud

Cypress has a cloud service that you can use to run your tests called the 'Cypress Cloud'. This is a great way to run your tests in a CI/CD pipeline. In this exercise we will connect to the Cypress Cloud, run our tests and see the results in the Cypress Cloud.

## Exercise 1. Connecting to the Cypress Cloud

1. If you have not done it yet, create a free Cypress Cloud account
2. Configure your local Cypress Configuration to make use of the Cypress Cloud
3. Run your tests from the commandline against the Cypress Cloud

## Bonus exercise

- run the tests in parallel using CICD
