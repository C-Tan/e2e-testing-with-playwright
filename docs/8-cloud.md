# Connecting to the cloud

> Connecting to the Cypress Cloud

Cypress has a cloud service that you can use to run your tests called the 'Cypress Cloud'. This is a great way to run your tests in a CI/CD pipeline. In this exercise we will connect to the Cypress Cloud, run our tests and see the results in the Cypress Cloud.

## Exercise 1. Connecting to the Cypress Cloud

1. If you have not done it yet, create a free Cypress Cloud account -> https://cloud.cypress.io/
2. Create a project within your Cypress Cloud.
3. Configure your project to use the Cypress Cloud.
4. Run your tests from the commandline against the Cypress Cloud

## Bonus exercise

- run the tests in parallel using CICD
